# CodeTest
 LoveMoney Code Test Example
 Web API & xUnit testing environment featuring JSON data.
 
 Improvements:
 
•	Completing the GetAlbumsPhotos method and testing environment requirements.
•	Create a link connection to the JSON URL raw data instead of copying static JSON into the project. Static JSON has better correlation to static database format.
•	Create more class encapsulation for the service and controller methods.
•	Naming property conflict when considering concatenation of the JSON files.
•	Async functionality.
•	Using string output for service methods, not IEnumberable<string>, to save memory.
